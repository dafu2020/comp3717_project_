### Project Purpose

PeePeeBoo, an Android-friendly application that allows users to easily add friends and view events that are both shared by the user and the friend.
PeePeeBoo makes it effortless to coordinate and collaborate with others in a single calendar. That means no more forgetting important appointments or double-bookings!
PeePeeBoo was made with the goal of being an integral part of managing oneâ€™s schedules through sharing and communication. We wanted your living room calendar, work calendar and social calendar in the palm of your hand, with features that allowed you to share within the calendar itself.


- As part of our COMP 3717 course, the goal was to design and build an Android application with these major features:
  - Create, edit, and delete events
  - Share reminders with friends in the application 
  - Functional user registration, login, and authentication

- Practice collaboration with team members in an agile development setting:
  - Sprint planning, using a Trello board to keep track of tasks
  - Using git for version control and methods such as cloning, branching, committing, pull requests, and merging branches 
  - Project Management
